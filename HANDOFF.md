# Handoff — 2026-09-27 · Composite snapshot, EOD data pipeline, F&O/FII fixes

## Repo state
- **`main` at `b4488d8`**: CI passing. Local `main` is synced, and the only untracked item is `archive/`.
- **Canonical checkout:** `D:\Kashti Claude\nse-smart-investor`.
  - `E:\code\nse-smart-investor` is an **empty folder**. Nothing should point at it.
- **Open PRs:** none from this work.
- **Remote branches:** `main`, `alerts/consolidate-fresh-workflow` (has an open PR, not ours), and `ux2-ticker-hover-preview`.
  - `ux2-ticker-hover-preview` is the closed #149 and is still waiting on the user's OK to delete.
- **Other work merged in parallel** (not from this session):
  - #174: wide layout is re-asserted on every page.
  - #175 and #178–#182: pages moved onto the mockup layout.
  - The trade_store pool now waits instead of raising `PoolError`.
  - The test suite is blocked from writing to production Postgres, and there's a purge tool for leaked rows.
  - Page-smoke background threads are joined.
  - The verdict_log dedup behaviour is pinned by tests.

## What shipped this session (#170 → #186)

**Composite golden snapshot (#170):**
- `tools/composite_golden.py` generates `data/composite_golden_snapshot.json`: 20 seeded synthetic cases replayed through `score_dataframe()`.
- They cover:
  - trend shapes and short history;
  - running without a benchmark (no RS);
  - bear-regime momentum on and off;
  - high VIX;
  - sector rank and flows;
  - delivery;
  - the positioning add-on on and off.
- `tests/test_composite_golden_snapshot.py` fails on any drift in score, grade, action, pillar points or entry levels. It also asserts that VIX doesn't move points, the bear option is on by default, and the 90/100 caps hold.
- **After an intentional scoring change:** run `py tools/composite_golden.py --update` and review the JSON diff in the PR.

**Technical pillar +1 bug (#171):**
- `_score_technical` summed `pts.values()`, which included the bool `sma_available` (from #163). That gave every stock with a 200-day SMA a free +1.
- It now sums `rsi + macd + sma + adx` explicitly.
- Also fixed: `test_signal_parity.py` failed on weekends because `bdate_range(end=Saturday)` returned n−1 dates.

**Direction-aware ADX: tested, not adopted (#172, docs only):**
- The rule tested: a downtrend (−DI ≥ +DI) is capped at the 1-point ADX tier.
- The result was worse, on the same data scored twice: 20-day IC went from +0.0205 to +0.0188, and the 60-day paired difference was −0.0034 (t −3.5).
- The losses sit in trend_down and range; trend_up was unchanged. Strong downtrends in this sample tended to rebound.
- Write-up: `docs/SCORE_EFFICACY_ADX_DIRECTION_2026-09-26.md`. **Don't retry this without a new angle.**

**Data-health freshness (#173):**
- `probe_stored_datasets()` in `dashboard/shared/data_health.py` reads `MAX(date)` from each of five tables: `fii_dii_daily`, `nse_fii_deriv_daily`, `nse_fno_oi_daily`, `nse_option_chain_daily` and `nse_delivery_daily`.
- It counts NSE sessions behind the latest completed session. That session is today after 20:00 IST, otherwise the previous one, and holidays come from `market_hours`.
- More than one session behind shows as **stale** under "needs attention", together with the refresh command.
- Results are cached for 10 minutes, over one pooled connection with a rollback after any failed query.

**EOD data pipeline moved to GitHub Actions (#177):**
- `.github/workflows/refresh-eod-data.yml` runs at 19:45 and 22:00 IST, Monday to Friday. It covers FII/DII, FII index futures, F&O OI, delivery and the option chain.
  - `--days 3` lets a missed evening heal on the next run.
  - Each step runs even if an earlier one failed.
  - The job fails fast if `DATABASE_URL` is missing.
- **Background:** before this, four Windows scheduled tasks pointed at the empty `E:\` folder and were refused (`0x800710E0`). The data had been stale since about Sep 18.
  - Those tasks are now **disabled**, not deleted, in case one fetch ever has to run locally again.
- **Repo secret `DATABASE_URL`:** it didn't exist before this session. That means the existing warm-top-picks and tomorrow-watchlist workflows had been writing to throwaway SQLite on the runner while reporting success. The user has since added it.
  - The value must be **only** the `postgres://…` URL, not the `url = "…"` line from `secrets.toml`.
- **First run:** every step passed, including the option chain, so NSE did not block the runner.
- **Option-chain cookie:** it can now also come from an `NSE_COOKIE` env var or secret. It isn't set, and wasn't needed on the first run.
- **Local catch-up:** Sep 18–25 filled for delivery, F&O OI and FII index futures. All five datasets are current.

**F&O universe drift (#184):**
- Removed 15 names that are absent from the 2026-09-25 F&O bhavcopy: ABFRL, ACC, BALKRISIND, DALBHARAT, DEEPAKNTR, IGL, IPCALAB, IRCTC, LTTS, NAVINFLUOR, PEL, SUNTV, SYNGENE, TATACHEM and TATACOMM. The list goes from 137 to 122.
- **LTIMindtree now trades as `LTM`** in both cash and F&O. `LTIM.NS` fetches had been failing, so it's renamed everywhere: `fno_universe`, the IT sector list in `data/fetcher.py`, `data/universe.py` and the name map in `dashboard/shared/cache.py`.
- #186 did the same for the valuation golden snapshot and `tools/validate_valuation.py`. It re-captured only that one ticker live: REASONABLE / low confidence, with every input present.

**FII index-futures sub-score (#185):**
- The fixed ±30,000-contract bands pinned the sub-score at 0, because live values sit near −300,000.
- It now uses the latest value's **percentile within the trailing ~250 stored sessions** (`data.nse_fii_deriv.get_latest_fut_idx_pct`): ≥80th → 3, ≥50th → 2, ≥20th → 1, else 0. With fewer than 60 sessions it scores the neutral 1.5.
- History was backfilled to 2024-09-06 (398 sessions). Today's value is at the 0.4th percentile (the most net-short in a year), so it scores 0.
- **The positioning add-on is opt-in** (`NSE_USE_POSITIONING_PILLAR`), so default live scores are unaffected.

**Page 02 speed:** no change needed.
- Its smoke-test call now takes 6.6 s under CI conditions, down from 103 s earlier in the session and about 200 s in the old handoff.
- The gain came from the parallel pool and thread fixes, not from this session.
- The old ~200 s figure was measured with the user-level `DATABASE_URL` set, so tests hit remote Postgres.

## Guard tests (they fail CI, so don't work around them)
- **Advice language:** `test_no_advice_copy.py` bans buy/sell/hold instruction copy in the UI and in `analysis/`.
- **Colours:** `test_tokens.py` allows no raw hex in pages.
- **Pages:** `test_pages_smoke.py` compiles and renders each page with the network blocked.
- **Scoring snapshot:** `test_composite_golden_snapshot.py` is new. When it fails, regenerate the snapshot on purpose rather than loosening the test.
- **Scoring behaviour:**
  - `test_bear_regime_vix_neutral.py`
  - `test_engine_audit_fixes.py`
  - `test_audit_fixes.py`, which includes the TECH-BOOL regression
  - `test_fii_deriv_percentile.py`
- **Valuation:** `test_valuation_golden_snapshot.py` (E1-v2).

## Open / next
1. **Watch the first scheduled `refresh-eod-data` runs** (Monday 19:45 IST) and the Data health panel. If NSE starts blocking the runner, set the `NSE_COOKIE` secret, or re-enable the relevant Windows task after pointing it at the `D:\` checkout.
2. **Confirm the warmers now reach Postgres.** Once `DATABASE_URL` exists, the `top_picks_snapshot` KV key should appear; the "Warmer" rows in Data health show it.
3. **The bear-regime weakness is still open.** The score ranks backwards in trend_down and risk_off markets, and ADX direction didn't help (#172). The next idea should target momentum and mean reversion, not trend strength.
4. **Validation gaps:** sector rank, flows, delivery % and positioning can't be replayed historically, and survivorship bias is not corrected. The positioning add-on shouldn't be switched on by default until it has been validated.
5. **Still to check by hand:**
   - the mobile layout on a real phone
   - the page 04 drift banner, which only appears during market hours
   - page 18 grade shades on a real screen
6. **Data sources:** Stooq has been dead since 2026-09-06 and adds a timeout to every fetch; consider a "known dead" switch. NSE corp-info times out intermittently.
7. **F&O list refresh:** re-check it against NSE's monthly circular. The drift warning in `fetch_nse_fno_bhavcopy` logs candidates.

## Gotchas
- **Local tests reach production Postgres unless you unset `DATABASE_URL`.** The user-level `DATABASE_URL` points at the production database; the suite now blocks writes, but reads and timings still go remote. To match CI, run `env -u DATABASE_URL py -m pytest ...`, then delete any `trades.db` it creates.
- **Stacked PRs and `--delete-branch`:** squash-merging the base PR deletes its branch, and that **closes** the stacked PR. Merge without deleting, or retarget the stacked PR to `main` first. Afterwards, rebase the stacked branch onto `main` to drop the pre-squash commits.
- **pytest summary grep:** the summary line reads `N passed, M deselected in …`, so grepping for `passed in` misses it. Use `tail`.
- **Profiling page 02:** `cProfile` under AppTest effectively hangs. A `sys._current_frames()` sampler thread works.
- **Background agents:** `isolation: remote` on the Agent tool ran **locally**, in `.claude/worktrees/`, not in the cloud. Verify where it ran, and clean up the worktree (`git worktree remove -f -f` if it's locked).
- **Don't switch branches in the main checkout while tests or agents are running.**
- **Research runs** take about 11 minutes and overwrite `research/output/`, so copy each run to `run_*/` first.
- **`gh pr checks N --watch`** before merging. `gh` sometimes drops the connection ("forcibly closed"); just retry.

## Conventions
- **No buy/sell/hold instruction copy, ever** (CLAUDE.md rule 1).
- **Composite is 0–90, as four pillars (40+25+15+10).** It goes up to 100 only with the opt-in positioning add-on. No candlestick component.
- **`analysis/` stays pure:** no Streamlit imports.
- **Scoring changes:** regenerate the composite snapshot on purpose, run the `verdict-regression-reviewer` agent, and for anything that re-ranks broadly, run a same-data efficacy A/B (`research.score_efficacy`).
- **Windows shell:** use `py`, with `PYTHONUTF8=1`.
- **Merging:** squash-merge after CI passes, when the user has asked for the merge.
